In this task, we will make a website that looks like [this](https://furends.netlify.app 'this').

### Pet The Pet!

1. Create a state for the pet image with an inital value of `pet.image`.
2. Pass it to the image src html tag.
3. Add an `onClick` to the button that changes the state from `"pet.image` to `"pet.image2"`
4. Test your code, the button should change the image to a gif!

### Search Bar

1. in `PetsList`, create a state called `query` and a method called `setQuery`.
2. In the input tag of `SearchBar` add an onChange method that calls `setQuery()` and gives it `event.target.value` as an argument.
3. At this point, whatever you type in your search bar should appear in the `query` state in `React Dev Tools`.
4. In your `PetsList`, filter your pets by comparing your pet's name with `query` using `includes`.
5. At this point, our search bar is case sensitive. Fix it so that it becomes case insensitive.

### Filter Pets by specie

1. in `PetsList`, create a state called `type` and a method called `setType`.
2. In the select tag of `PetSelector` add an onChange method that calls `setType()` and gives it `event.target.value` as an argument.
3. At this point, whatever you select in your selector should appear in the `type` state in `React Dev Tools`.
4. In your `PetsList`, filter your pets by comparing your pet's type with `type` using `includes`.

### Challenge

1. Move all your search bar code to it's own component and pass setQuery as a prop to your new component.
2. Move all your selector code to it's own component and pass setType as a prop to your new component.
